# NLP-Text-Editor

I created a prototype for a text editor similar to that of Google Docs or Microsft Word. It is able to create new files, save them, and then re-open them. It is also able to copy and paste natively within the program. However, I added a few natural language processing elements on a seperate side menu. I utilzed a lemmanizer and simplified lesk algorithm, to create a modified dictionary. Similarly, I created a thesaurus using wordnet lemmas. I also implemented a spell checker from a tutorial I found online(link is provided below). Finally, I implemented a word predictor similar to the one used in gmail. It is a tensorflow model and a "Fake or Real News" dataset.
